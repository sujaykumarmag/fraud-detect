# Healthcare Fraud Detection using Big Data and Deep Anomaly Detection


This project focuses on detecting healthcare fraud using big data analysis techniques. Leveraging the power of CMS big data, the project employs Deep Anomaly Detection methods, along with techniques like SMOTE and PCA for sampling and dimensionality reduction. The ultimate goal is to achieve an accuracy score greater than 85% while minimizing the occurrence of False Positives. 

## Dataset 

`https://data.cms.gov`

## Features

- Utilizes CMS big data for healthcare fraud detection.
- Applies Deep Anomaly Detection methods for improved accuracy.
- Utilizes SMOTE for balancing class distribution.
- Aims for an accuracy score greater than 85% while minimizing False Positives.
